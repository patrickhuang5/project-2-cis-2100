# project-2-cis-2100
This project analyzes synthetic transactional data using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to understand customer behavior and trends, such as the most prevalent products in customer baskets, the frequency of large-basket buyers, the top stores with large-basket buyers, and demographic product preferences.

## Overview
The system performs the following tasks:

- Generate Synthetic Data: The program generates synthetic data simulating 2,000 customer transactions across 10 stores, with products from various categories and demographic groups.

- Most Prevalent Products: Identifies and visualizes the most popular products purchased by customers, based on the frequency of their occurrence in transaction records.

- Large Basket Analysis: Analyzes transactions where the total value exceeds a given threshold (default: $100), and visualizes the distribution of transaction totals.

- Stores with Large-Basket Buyers: Identifies and ranks stores by the frequency of large-basket transactions, visualizing the top stores with the highest percentage of large-basket buyers.

- Top Products by Demographic: Analyzes the top products purchased by specific age demographics, providing insights into customer preferences by age group.

- Basket Category Analysis: Analyzes and visualizes the product category distribution in customer baskets (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Groceries).
